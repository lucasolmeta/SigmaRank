**Current Progress:**
- Completed: ingest
- In Progress: features

**Things to come back to:**

- We currently have survivorship bias as a result of choosing random S&P500 tickers
    - Remedy is to randomly select any 50 active tickers at start of specified timeframe, and add functionality to deal with take-private transactions, bankrupcies, and tickers which are otherwise now inactive
